The waypoints script is used to tell the enemies were to go. So you can create a few empty scene objects and then set them up as waypoints. You can see how I have it set up in the example scene i included in the folder. all you have to to is just set at least two waypoints and attach the waypoints script to the parent.

Then you can just place the movetowaypoiny script onto the enemy character, give it a reference for the waypoints and they will automatically move on their own.

Check the scene I made if you're not sure how it works.
